# Identifying Customer Preference toward Beach Resort Activities Using Apriori Algorithm
*Final Project in Integrative Programming and Technologies 1*

### Introduction
Prior to the imposition of travel restrictions and nationwide lockdowns, the travel and tourism sector contributed 22.5 percent of the Philippine economy's GDP (World Travel & Tourism Council, April 2022). Part of the travel and tourism sector is the Philippine beach resort industry. It is a key to the country's thriving tourism sector, which is characterized by rapid growth and reliance on the sale of capital-intensive services. This industry falls somewhere between large business and small business.

With over seven thousand islands, the Philippine archipelago has a seemingly endless supply of beaches and surf spots. Beach resorts offer a variety of activities, with varying levels of satisfaction. Many visitors come to beach resorts to find relaxation. They want to engage in an activity that requires minimal physical effort while providing maximum satisfaction. When asked about the experience of a beach resort, people often praise the activities and facilities within the resort.

### Problem Definition
Due to the relaxation of travel restrictions and easing of testing and quarantine requirements, tourist arrivals to the Philippines is expected to increase in comparison to the past two years. As the Philippine beach resort industry recovers, it is important for beach resort owners to know and understand the preferences of their customers regarding which activities to participate in during their stay at the beach resort.

This study aims to gain a thorough understanding of customer preferences for beach resort activities by implementing the Apriori algorithm and association rules in Python. The findings of the study can be used by beach resort owners to promote the activities they want to see developed or to eliminate those they don't want to continue offering. On the basis of providing a comfortable experience to the customers, the activities offered at the beach resort can be improved, allowing to attract more customers and thus increase business opportunities.

### Description of Dataset
This study evaluates customer preference based on the demographic variable sex of the customer. The dataset used in this study is divided into two categories: Male and Female, each with 50 customers. Eight beach resort activities, including “Swimming”, “Wind Surfing”, “Kayaking”, “Snorkeling”, “Banana boating”, “Jetski”, “Parasailing”, and “Island Hopping”, were used as items in the transactions, with each customer considered as a transaction.
